<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The expression ontology is an ontology to represent mathematical expressions from the  engineering domain.  The ontology and is used are documented in [1]. Precursors of the model developed simultaneously are published in [2,3]. The ontology reuses concepts from the OntoCAPE [4] and OpenMath [5] ontologies. The ontology is implemented using the free protege tool (protege.stanford.edu) [5].
